This repo contains simple pages, made during MMC School course and pages, which are copies of some real websites, with some elements of my iniciative.

1. Creative Design - the simple page with subpages, at this moment not responsive, just to practice basic html-css knowledge.
2. Creative Design2 - first responsive page, to practice RWD.
3. Abstract - excercise from https://www.frontendpractice.com/
